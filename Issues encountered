Issues encountered:
- tictactoe: 
  - In code setup, you assumed return type 'Player 1' when it should have been 'A', 'B', 'Draw'
  - In identification, overcomplicated identifciation of graphs and dfs
  - Making mistakes about possible range values, sometimes not paying attention to the entire description 
  - you tend to miss colons 

- vlaidate bst:
  - lack of famliarity with class construction
  - forgot self in __init__
  - increase accuracy of identifying syntax errors line by line
  	- examples are missing semicolons, undefined variable names, mixing up string literals vs. variable names 
  - you confuse object types so the val not the actual node 
  - constructing trees was unfamiliar

- pivot
  - 

 - delete node 
  - remember to return dummy.next not head in case head gets deleted

 - cool string
  - defaultdicts can't be initialized w 0, it must be int if you want default value to be 0
  - the case 'bac'
  - it's not possible to subscript sets, if you want to subscript a list, wrap a list around it
  - add to a set, append to a list
